# TrussWorks

## Company blurb

Truss works side by side with our clients to design, build, and scale modern software that exceeds standards for speed and security. We often work with private sector, civic tech, healthcare, and U.S. government organizations.

## Company size

About 70 folks as of June 2019.

## Remote status

We are a distributed organization! We have folks in every US mainland timezone working from many states.

## Region

USA only; many of our contracts with the US government and with US healthcare providers require that work is done in the US.

## Company technologies

Lots, to be honest. Our clients tend to use tools like Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and Java (for data processing pipelines). We tend to use tools like Go, Python, modern JavaScript, AWS, terraform. Our projects are often web applications deployed into cloud environments, and not always; we've done data processing pipelines, native mobile applications, and various kinds of workshop training (design and engineering) as well.

## Office locations

We have a small office in San Francisco; however, it's effectively a co-working space for some of the SF based folks. All meetings, systems, processes, and tools are designed for use from anywhere with a reliable network connection and a working computer.
